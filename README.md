# 🏠 Chennai Housing Price Prediction using XGBoost 🚀

This project predicts housing prices in Chennai using the XGBoost machine learning model. It leverages data-driven techniques to provide accurate price estimations based on features such as location, size, and amenities.

## ✨ Features

- ⚡ Uses XGBoost, a powerful and efficient machine learning algorithm
- 📊 Predicts housing prices based on various property attributes
- 🛠️ Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- 📈 Model evaluation with metrics and visualizations

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chennai-housing-xgboost.git
    cd chennai-housing-xgboost
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## ▶️ Usage

1. **Prepare your dataset**  
   Ensure you have the Chennai housing dataset in the correct format (see data/ folder or project documentation).
